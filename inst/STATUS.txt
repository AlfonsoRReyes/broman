Library broman
==============

Version 0.23, 11/20/2008:

    Revised perm.test and paired.perm.test so that they can return the
    actual permutation results (rather than just the p-value), though
    the default is still to just return the p-value.

    Fixed a bug in myround().

Version 0.22, 9/19/2008:

    Revised attachfile and attachwork so that they return (invisibly)
    TRUE/FALSE according to whether the file was found.

    Also added an argument 'verbose'; if TRUE and the file can't be
    loaded, a warning is given.

Version 0.21, 2/29/2008:

    Added a function normalize() for doing quantile normalization.

Version 0.20, 1/18/2007:

    Modified fisher() so that the p-value is Prop'n >= rather
    than just >.

    Added a similar function, chisq() for doing a chi-square test
    with p-value calculated by simulation.  In 0.20-2, suppressed
    warnings produced by chisq.test.


Version 0.19, 10/9/2007:

    Added a function runningratio, for calculating
    sum(numerator)/sum(denominator) in sliding window.

    Fixed some errors in the help files.


Version 0.18, 9/20/2007:

    Fixed a bug in loadwork().


Version 0.17, 1/16/2006:
  
    Added a function h() for getting access to html help files while
    running R via ESS within emacs.


Version 0.16, 12/19/2006:

    Added a function runningmean().

    Fixed a bug in paired.perm.test().


Version 0.15, 8/14/2006

    Added a function myround().
	

Version 0.14, 6/28/2006

    Added a function mypairs(), similar to pairs() but producing only
    the upper triangle.

    Added a convert2hex() function.


Version 0.13, 12/8/2004

    Added attachfile() and loadfile(), similar to loadwork() and
    attachwork(). 

Version 0.12, 8/6/2004

    Added little utility functions loadwork() and attachwork()
    for loading or attaching .RData files of the form
    "dir*/.RData", when * is an integer, and especially when
    dir = "Work".

Version 0.11, 4/29/2002:

    Added perm.test and paired.perm.test for getting p-values for a
    two-sample t-statistic by permutation.

    There was an obvious bug in the function fisher(), which is now
    fixed. 


Version 0.10, 11/21/2001:

    This is a package to contain miscellaneous R functions that I find
    useful.  

    Currently, it contains functions to get SEs of sample quantiles, 
    a sampling version of fisher.test, a re-parse of the output of
    qr(), simulation from a multivariate normal distribution, and
    numerical integration by Simpson's rule.
